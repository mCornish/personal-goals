## Week in Review
This week didn't go at all as expected. I was prepared to wait a little while longer to find a job, but I didn't have to! Applications and interviews took up time that otherwise would have gone to writing and reading. I decided not to put any time into Wordpress since that effort would go to waste if I ended up landing one of the jobs. Sure enough, I did. Next week, I'll mostly be concerned with getting up to speed on everything as a QA Engineer at PlayPosit.
