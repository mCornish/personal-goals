## Week in Review
I told myself last week that I would start maintaining this repository. I've made it this far, so it seems to be going well. My Twitter activity this week wasn't as great as I would have liked since I was pushing job applications pretty hard, but I managed to get a follow from Eric Elliot, so I must've done something right. My two phone interviews went alright and I'm hoping they lead to in-person interviews, which I'm much better at. If I can land one of these jobs, I can't even describe how much more at ease I'll be. Ironically, my focus next week is front-end confidence even though neither of my potential jobs are front-end positions. Still, I'm sticking with it.
