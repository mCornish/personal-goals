# Mike Cornish's Personal Goals
It's easier to take your next step when you have a destination in mind. I share pretty much everything, so why not share my goals as well? Inspired by [Una Krevets](http://una.im/personal-goals-guide/#üíÅ).

2. Contribute to Open Source
2. Solidify [devStory](http://www.devstory.mikecornish.net/) Format
